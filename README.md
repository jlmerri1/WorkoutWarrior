# WorkoutWarrior-Fall-2016
This was a final iOS project for a mobile app class from the fall of 2016.

This app allows users to look up workouts based on the muscle group they choose.  Once choosen, a list of workouts are shown.
After the user selects the workout of choice a new screen with and image of the workout will appear.  This screen also has 
rest countdown timers, link to previous pages, and the ability to add workouts to a database for later retrieval.  This portion
of the app is still under construction.
